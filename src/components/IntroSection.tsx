          Since beginning my journey as a frontend web developer over 3 years
          ago, I&apos;ve done work for agencies, for startups, and collaborated
          with talented people to create digital products for both business and
          consumer use. I&apos;m quietly confident, naturally curious, and
          perpetually working on improving my chops one design problem at a
          time.
