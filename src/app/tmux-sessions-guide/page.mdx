<br />

Tmux is a powerful tool that can help you manage **multiple terminal sessions** on a **single terminal screen**. It allows you to split your terminal window into **multiple panes**, each of which you can use to run different commands or programs. You can also create **multiple windows** within a single tmux session, allowing you to switch between multiple sessions, windows and panes.

<br />
<br />

Let's just get started with tmux ðŸ”¥

<br />
<br />

I'm assuming that you have already installed tmux in your system. In order to verify that tmux is installed or not, you can run the following command in your terminal.

<br />

```bash
tmux -V
```

<br />

It should output something like this: **tmux 3.2a** depending upon the version of tmux that you have already installed.

<br />
<br />

## Sessions

In order to get started with tmux sessions, let's first learn, how we can create a new session

<br />

#### Creating a tmux session

In order to create a new tmux session, run the following command in your terminal.

<br />

```bash
tmux
```
<br />

A new tmux session will be created.

<br />

You will see a status bar at the bottom of your terminal window. It will show you the session name, system info & datetime.

<br />

<br />
<br />

#### Detaching from a tmux session

In order to detach from a tmux session, you can press the prefix key, `Ctrl + b` and then `d` . This will detach you from the session and you will be back to your normal terminal.

<br />

After detaching, you will see a screen like this.

<br />

<br />
<br />

#### Creating a named tmux session

You can also create a named session by running the following command.

<br />

```bash
tmux new -s <session-name>
```
<br />

Just replace `<session-name>` with the name of your session.

<br />

Let's say, I want to create a tmux session with name **my-session** then i will run the following command.

<br />

```bash
tmux new -s my-session
```
<br />

It will create a brand new tmux session with name **my-session**.

<br />

<br />
<br />

#### Listing all the tmux sessions (Outside of tmux)

You can list all the tmux sessions by running the following command.

<br />

```bash
tmux ls
```
<br />

It will list all the tmux sessions that are currently running.

<br />

<br />
<br />

#### Attaching to a tmux session

Let's say that just detached from a tmux session, and you want to re-attach to that session. You can do that by running the following command.

<br />

```bash
tmux a
```

<br />

It will re-attach you to the last session that you were in.

<br />

You can also attach to a specific session by running the following command.

<br />

```bash
tmux a -t <session-name>
```
<br />

Just replace `<session-name>` with the name of your session.

<br />
<br />

#### Listing all the tmux sessions (Inside of tmux)

If you are already inside of a tmux session, you can list all the running tmux sessions by pressing the prefix key, `Ctrl + b` and then `s` .

<br />

It will open up a **sessions list view** that will list out all the running tmux sessions.

<br />

<BlogPostImage image={ListAllSessionsInsideTmux} />

<br />
<br />

#### Switching between tmux sessions

Let's say that there are multiple tmux sessions running, you are already attached to a tmux session and you want to switch to another session. In order to do that, Just press the prefix key, `Ctrl + b` and then `s` .

<br />

It will open up a **sessions list view** that will list out all the running tmux sessions. You can navigate through the list using the `arrow keys` or `j & k` and then press `Enter` to switch to that session.

<br />
<br />

#### Renaming a tmux session
In order to rename a tmux session, you can press the prefix key, `Ctrl + b` and then `:` , it will open up a command prompt at the bottom of your terminal. You can then run the following command.

<br />

```bash
rename-session -t <old-session-name> <new-session-name>
```

<br />

Just replace `<old-session-name>` with the name of your old session and `<new-session-name>` with the name of your new session.

<br />
<br />

#### Killing a tmux session

While killing a session, you can either be inside of a tmux session or outside of a tmux session.

<br />

If you are outside of a tmux session, you can run the following command.

<br />

```bash
tmux kill-session -t <session-name>
```

<br />

If you are inside of a tmux session.

<br />

You can press the prefix key, `Ctrl + b` and then `:`, it will open up a command prompt at the bottom of your terminal. You can then run the following command.

<br />

```bash
kill-session -t <session-name>
```

<br />

Just replace `<session-name>` with the name of your session.

<br />

<br />

OR

<br />

You can use the **sessions list view** inside of tmux to kill sessions by navigating to the session with the `arrow keys` or `j & k` and pressing the `x` key. It will ask you to confirm the action, just press `y` to confirm and that particular session will be killed.

<br />

<br />

**Note:** Just make sure that you are not killing the currently active session.

<br />

That's it for tmux sessions ðŸš€
