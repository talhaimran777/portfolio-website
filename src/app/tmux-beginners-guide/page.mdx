Tmux is a powerful tool that can help you manage **multiple terminal sessions** in a **single window**. It allows you to split your terminal window into **multiple panes**, each of which you can run different commands or programs. You can also create **multiple windows** within a single tmux session, allowing you to switch between different sets of sessions, windows and panes.

<br />

Let's just get started with tmux ðŸ”¥

<br />
<br />

I'm assuming that you have already installed tmux in your system. In order to verify that tmux is installed or not, you can run the following command in your terminal.

<br />

```bash
tmux -V
```

<br />

It should output something like this: **tmux 3.2a** depending upon the version of tmux that you have already installed.

<br />
<br />

## Sessions

In order to get started with sessions, let&apos;s just first try creating a new session.

Run this following command in your terminal.

<br />

```bash
tmux
```

<br />

After running this command, you will see a status bar at the bottom of your terminal window. This status bar will show you the name of the session, user&apos;s info, the time and the date.

<br />

It will look something like this.
